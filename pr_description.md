## Coverage Boost Implementation Summary

### 🎯 **Objective Achieved**
Successfully improved fast-track coverage to meet CI baseline requirements and beyond.

**No contract logic changes** - Only test additions to improve coverage.

### 📊 **Coverage Improvements**

**Before:**
- Statements: 36.28% 
- Lines: 35.07%
- Functions: 42.86%

**After:**
- Statements: 71.68% (+35.4%)
- Lines: 75.37% (+40.3%)
- Functions: 75.32% (+32.46%)

**Baseline Requirement:** 31% ✅ (Exceeded by 130%+)

### 🧪 **Tests Added**

1. **Fixed Invariants Test** (`test/invariants.spec.ts`)
   - Fixed JSON structure access to match actual deployment file format
   - All tests now pass (130/130)

2. **Enhanced Coverage Boost Tests** (`test/fast/coverage-boost.spec.ts`)
   - Treasury shortfall calculation and balance function coverage
   - TrancheManagerV2 governance toggles coverage
   - Both branches of `getLiquidityStatus()` covered

3. **New OperationalAgreement Tests** (`test/fast/operational-agreement.spec.ts`)
   - Complete coverage of all functions and access control paths
   - Constructor validation with zero address checks
   - Role-based access control testing
   - Member management (approve/revoke)
   - Pool whitelisting functionality
   - All error conditions and edge cases

### 🎯 **Coverage Targets Hit**

- **Treasury.sol**: `balance()` and `getLiquidityStatus()` shortfall branch ✅
- **TrancheManagerV2.sol**: `setIssuanceLocked()` and `adjustSuperSeniorCap()` governance paths ✅
- **OperationalAgreement.sol**: All functions and access control paths ✅

### ✅ **Quality Assurance**

- **All Tests Passing**: 130/130 tests pass ✅
- **Security Analysis**: 0 high severity issues ✅
- **Coverage Threshold**: 71.68% vs 31% baseline ✅
- **No Contract Changes**: Only test additions, no core logic modifications ✅
