Key Files Included:

- test/security/reentrancy.spec.ts (quarantined)
- test/utils/nav-helpers.ts (NAV API helpers)
- hardhat.config.ts (configuration)
- package.json (dependencies)

Evidence of the Bug:
1. Interface Mismatch: IIssuanceControllerV3 defines 4-parameter mintFor, but implementation uses 5 parameters
2. AmountZero Error: Contract reverts at line 807 with AmountZero() despite receiving correct calldata
3. Mirror Contract Proof: Test harness proves calldata is correctly encoded and sent
4. Quarantined Tests: Multiple test files quarantined with this.skip() referencing Issue #61

Next Steps:
1. Align interface signature with implementation
2. Investigate parameter shadowing/overwrite in mintFor function
3. Add debug events to pinpoint where usdcAmt becomes zero
4. Fix the contract bug and unquarantine tests
