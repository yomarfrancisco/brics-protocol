## Critical Invariants

### 1. Token Supply Conservation
```solidity
// Invariant: totalIssued must be conserved across all operations
// Issue: totalIssued += tokensOut
// Burn: totalIssued -= tokensBurned
// Instant Redeem: totalIssued -= tokensBurned
// NAV Settlement: totalIssued -= tokensBurned
```

### 2. Emergency Level Consistency
```solidity
// Invariant: Emergency level must be consistent across all contracts
// ConfigRegistry.emergencyLevel() must match all contract states
// Issuance must be halted in RED state regardless of oracle degradation
```

### 3. Buffer Coordination
```solidity
// Invariant: Buffer health must be maintained across all liquidity sources
// Treasury IRB + PreTrancheBuffer must meet emergency requirements
// Issuance must be blocked if buffers are insufficient
```

### 4. Sovereign Capacity Limits
```solidity
// Invariant: Sovereign utilization must not exceed hard caps
// Soft cap: Linear damping between softCap and hardCap
// Hard cap: No issuance allowed when utilization >= hardCap
```

### 5. Oracle Degradation Safety
```solidity
// Invariant: Oracle degradation must be conservative
// STALE: 2% haircut, continue operations
// DEGRADED: 5% haircut, reduced capacity
// EMERGENCY_OVERRIDE: 10% haircut, emergency signers only
```

### 6. Role-Based Access Control
```solidity
// Invariant: All critical operations must be role-gated
// GOV_ROLE: Governance decisions
// ECC_ROLE: Emergency Control Committee
// OPS_ROLE: Operational actions
// MINTER_ROLE: Token minting
// BURNER_ROLE: Token burning
```

### 7. NAV Redemption Lifecycle
```solidity
// Invariant: NAV redemption must follow strict lifecycle
// Request → Queue → Strike → Settlement (T+5)
// Claims must be frozen during freeze period
// Settlement must respect buffer availability
```

### 8. Sovereign Guarantee Integrity
```solidity
// Invariant: Sovereign guarantee must follow legal framework
// Trigger → Notice (T+7) → Acknowledgment → Settlement (T+90)
// Tier 2 expansion requires legal milestones
// Coverage calculation must be accurate
```

## Security Considerations

### Reentrancy Protection
- All external calls protected with ReentrancyGuard
- Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern enforced
- No recursive calls to critical functions

### Access Control
- Role-based permissions with granular control
- Emergency powers with automatic sunset clauses
- Multi-signature requirements for critical operations

### Oracle Security
- Quorum-based NAV updates
- Conservative degradation with haircuts
- Emergency signer override capability
- Nonce-based replay protection

### Buffer Security
- Coordinated buffer checks across all liquidity sources
- Emergency auto-pause on buffer depletion
- Cascading funding mechanisms

### Coverage Limitations
**Coverage execution model**: Fast CI coverage excludes IssuanceControllerV3 and NAVOracleV3 due to instrumentation stack depth; a nightly "heavy coverage" job includes all contracts under a coverage-friendly compiler profile (optimizer/viaIR off). Coverage floors are enforced (fast: 70%, nightly: 75%) and will be ratcheted up.

- **Fast CI**: Excludes complex contracts for quick feedback (70% floor)
- **Nightly Heavy**: Includes all contracts with coverage-friendly compiler (75% floor)
- **Compiler Profile**: Optimizer disabled, viaIR disabled for instrumentation compatibility
- **Quality Gates**: Automated coverage threshold enforcement with ratcheting strategy

#### Fast CI Exclusions (Coverage Instrumentation Stack Depth)
- `contracts/IssuanceControllerV3.sol` - Complex issuance logic with multiple state variables
- `contracts/NAVOracleV3.sol` - Oracle aggregation with cryptographic operations
- `contracts/MezzanineVault.sol` - Complex vault logic with multiple inheritance
- `contracts/RedemptionClaim.sol` - Complex claim processing with multiple structs
- `contracts/SovereignClaimToken.sol` - ERC721 implementation with complex state
- `contracts/malicious/` - Test contracts for security validation
- `contracts/mocks/` - Mock contracts for testing

**Rationale**: These contracts exceed Solidity's stack depth limit when instrumented for coverage. They are validated through comprehensive tests and Slither security analysis. The nightly heavy coverage job attempts to include all contracts with coverage-friendly compiler settings.

### Accepted Findings & Fingerprint Policy

**Security Gate Approach**: The CI security job uses a fingerprint-based allowlist system to distinguish between acceptable and unacceptable security findings. This ensures transparency while maintaining strict security standards.

#### Fingerprint Format
Each allowlisted finding is identified by a unique fingerprint: `${ruleId}:${file}:${line}`
- **ruleId**: Slither's internal rule identifier (e.g., "1-1-divide-before-multiply")
- **file**: Contract file path relative to project root
- **line**: Exact line number where the finding occurs

#### Allowlist Criteria
Findings are only allowlisted if they meet ALL criteria:
1. **Tested and Verified**: Comprehensive test coverage proves the behavior is safe
2. **Documented Rationale**: Clear explanation of why the finding is acceptable
3. **Low Risk Level**: Risk assessment confirms minimal impact
4. **Accepted by Security Owner**: Explicit approval from security team

#### Current Allowlisted Findings
- **divide-before-multiply** (5 instances): Precision loss in mathematical calculations that are tested and verified safe
  - All instances are in core issuance logic with comprehensive test coverage
  - Precision loss is documented and validated through edge case testing
  - Risk level: Low (tested, documented, accepted)

#### Approval Process
Changes to `audit/slither-allowlist.json` require:
1. **Security Owner Approval**: @yomarfrancisco must approve all changes
2. **Documentation Update**: Rationale must be added to `audit/slither-highs.md`
3. **Test Validation**: Comprehensive tests must prove the finding is safe
4. **Risk Assessment**: Clear risk level and impact analysis

**No broad exclusions**: The system only allows specific, fingerprinted findings. No rule-based exclusions are permitted.
