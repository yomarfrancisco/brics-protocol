- **Governance Deadlock**: Automatic resolution with emergency powers and sunset clauses

### **Regulatory Risks**
- **Basel III Changes**: Flexible framework adaptable to evolving requirements
- **MiFID II Updates**: Modular compliance system with regular updates
- **Local Regulation Changes**: South African CFI framework with regulatory consultation

### **Operational Risks**
- **Institutional Failure**: Multiple backup institutions and emergency procedures
- **Market Stress**: Progressive emergency states with graduated institutional responses
- **Technology Failure**: Redundant systems with conservative failover mechanisms

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Complete SPEC §4 (NAV Redemption Lane)
2. **Short-term**: Complete SPEC §5 (Oracle Degradation)
3. **Medium-term**: Institutional integration (NASASA, Old Mutual)
4. **Long-term**: Production deployment and regulatory approval
