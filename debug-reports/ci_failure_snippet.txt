CI Failure Snippet Placeholder
=============================

This file would contain the ~40 lines around the failing CI assertion from the reentrancy/precision test error.

The original CI failure was in test/security/reentrancy.spec.ts around line 137-138:
"SMOKE: reentrancy test fixture deploys correctly"

Error: AssertionError: expected 1000000000000000000 to equal 1000000000000000000000000000
+ expected - actual
-1000000000000000000
+1000000000000000000000000000

This was caused by precision issues with BigInt rounding in NAV conversions.
The test was expecting 1e18 but getting 1e27 due to incorrect NAV format handling.

The fix involved:
1. Using proper RAY format (1e27) for NAV values
2. Using divRoundHalfUp for deterministic BigInt rounding
3. Replacing direct oracle calls with compat helpers

If you have a local CI log file, paste the relevant ~40 lines here.
