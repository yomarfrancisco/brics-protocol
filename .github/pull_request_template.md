## BRICS Protocol Context

**What is BRICS Protocol?**
An institution-grade synthetic risk transfer infrastructure for emerging market bank loan portfolios ($2.3T opportunity). It creates sovereign-backed, AAA-grade synthetic assets that function like stablecoins but survive like AAA bonds.

**Key Innovation**: Multi-layered capital stack with sovereign guarantee integration, enabling crisis expansion (105-108% detachment) and cross-sovereign hedging.

**Institutional Requirements**: 
- Legal framework compliance (PFMA/ISDA)
- Crisis resilience and emergency response
- Multi-sovereign coordination
- Basel-aligned capital controls
